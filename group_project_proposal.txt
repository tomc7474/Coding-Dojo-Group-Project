The concept for this site is that it would be a
social media site for sharing thoughts on movies
and adding them to a database. The user would make an
account with their name, email, password, and a
short bio. They would then be able to look at the 
list of added films and click on them to bring them
to its page. At that page they would be able to see 
information regarding the film, such as director,
release date, production company, cast, aggregate
review score, and plot synopsis. Also on this page
the user will be able to see all user reviews for 
this film, and make their own, giving their 
thoughts and a score. If the user wants to add a 
movie to the database they can do so and add the 
information above for a new film. If the user 
wishes to see their own page or the page of another
user they can do so, and they will be able to see the
desired user's name, date joined, bio, and all of 
their movie reviews. If the user wishes to edit any 
reviews they've created they can do that on this page
as well. If they wish they can also edit their 
information.

Some optional goals would be to add an image uploader
so the user would be able to add a poster of the
film. If possible it would also be interesting to add
more ideas for user interaction, such as likes and 
dislikes on reviews, and a response system.
